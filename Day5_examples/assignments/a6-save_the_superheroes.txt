ASSIGNMENT 6 - SAVE THE SUPERHEROES

*** This is a text file. You NEED to complete this assignment in a python file (.py as the file extension).


For this assignment, you will be modifying the Superhero Team Builder that was completed in Assignment 4.

The first thing you will need to do is ask the user if they want to start a create a new team, 
or add to an existing one. This can be done with a menu that has two options. 

If the user wants to start from scratch, you will then need to ask them how many heroes they want to add
and get the information for those heroes, just like in Assignment 4. 
INSTEAD of printing the heroes information back out to the user, you should save them to a JSON file
and tell the user the name of the file where their heroes can be found.

If the user wants to add on to an existing team, you need to ask the user for the name of a JSON file. 
You will then read in the data from the file the user gave you, and store it into your list. 
Then, you can ask them for the number of superheroes they want to add to the team, and get their
info, just like in Assignment 4. Then, you will save the new heroes to the user's existing 
JSON file (the one the user told you to use). Of course, let the user know that their new heroes have been 
saved to the file they provided. 

As always, make sure you use proper variable and function naming conventions and comment your code!

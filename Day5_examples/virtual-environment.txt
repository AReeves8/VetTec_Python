creating virtual environment

the following command will create a virtual python environment called ".venv" 
python -m venv .venv
OR
python3 -m venv .venv

IF you need to install the venv command:
sudo apt install python3-venv

you can call it whatever you want, but .venv is most commonly used



once you created the virtual environment, you need to activate it with one of the following commands:

WINDOWS:    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
LINUX:      source .venv/bin/activate


now if you run "pip freeze" nothing shows up since our enviornment is clean


we can then install new libraries using pip
pip install boto3


now we can do pip freeze again, but export it to a file - requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt


the point is that now, someone else can run a pip install with your requirements file:
pip install -r requirements.txt 

...and install everything that was in your environment. 
that makes it so everyone working on something can be sure to have the same environment


to leave your virtual environment just run the "deactivate" command

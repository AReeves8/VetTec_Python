ASSIGNMENT 4 - SUPERHERO TEAM UP

*** This is a text file. You NEED to complete this assignment in a python file (.py as the file extension).


Write a python program that asks the user to build a superhero team. 

First, you should ask the user how many superheroes they want to put on their team. 
Then, you will prompt the user for information about that hero. 

The information you need to ask for is:
    Superhero name
    Primary super power
    Strength level

For each super hero, you need to store the information into a DICTIONARY where the above attributes are the keys and the and info input by the user are the values.

Then, you need to add the superhero (with all their info inside a dictionary) into a LIST.

Lastly, you need to loop through the list and print out each superheroes information in properly formatted string. 

As always, be sure to use proper variable while writing this program.

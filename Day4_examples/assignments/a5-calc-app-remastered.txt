ASSIGNMENT 5 - CALCULATOR APP REMASTERED

*** This is a text file. You NEED to complete this assignment in a python file (.py as the file extension).


Take your completed Calculator App from assignment 3, and re-work it to use functions that are in seperate files. 

Create a function the prints the menu and returns the selected option. 
This function should be called in place of printing the menu in the main program.

Next, create function(s) that prompt the user for their numbers that they would like to perform the operation on. 
Make sure the function(s) only return valid numbers!

Additionally, create a function that takes in two numbers and the user's selected option. 
This should then perform the selected operation and return the result.

Every function should be in its own file, and the main program should import each of the other files. 


As always, be sure to use proper variable and function names while writing this program.


I advise you create a new folder to put all these files in. You may turn in a .zip folder with all these python files if you'd like.
